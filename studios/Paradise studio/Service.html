                    <h3>Photography</h3> 
                    <p>Photography is the art, application and 
                      practice of creating durable images by 
                      recording light or other electromagnetic radiation,
                       either electronically by means of an image sensor, 
                       or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material
                        such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields 
                        of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, 
                        as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production,
                         recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.And also we give service to Wedding ceremony,Engagement,Birthday,Baptism,Party etc.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or
                       emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive
                        surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic
                         image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which
                          is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for 
                          subsequent display or processing. </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>The result with photographic emulsion
                      is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into 
                      a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of 
                      the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image
                       on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image 
                       on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>
